        Hello! I'm a front-end developer who enjoys creating visually appealing
        and functional web projects. This Poster Gallery is a small React-based
        project where I display posters from categories like Marvel, DC, and
        Anime. I built this project to improve my React skills and experiment
        with layouts and styling.
      </p>
